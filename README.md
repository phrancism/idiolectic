## Judgments
Judgments  
To turn and shuffled through  
Here in his nose  
That theory  
Parents and though they would have used  
I drank  
Knowing that idea  
That theory  
Associated  
Not Owen’s obscure war  
The dried  
A new perspective

## Timothy's Soiree
In Timothy’s soirée  
The interior  
With its universality  
Hours ago as a few months  
And always be played  
Beautiful view  
Open  
Few friends and unpacking  
Into view the flowers finally sees  
A single person  
Does that haunt his hesitance

## Crumb-flecked
The crumb-flecked  
The Southern California Confucius fury  
Ourselves lost six-to-seven  
In the clouds in a 1990's  
And God that would be able to  
Like people in my mind  
Wandering their humanity recalling  

## In Ojai
Of the shade of his seat and I  
Love you ever heard yelling  
With Jenna more than twenty  
In Ojai  
Up all strewn  
Squishy  
One direction wandering  
And continued to make trips  
To any of that passionate  
Filled with cynicism  
He was wont to stop them  
For one that Kenny what seemed  

## After Alfred
Someone somewhere  
Dissolve only to both ramblings  
Ad infinitum until  
For attention diverted  
But still out hopping  
Up stairs he stepped  
Music that seemed to cope  
Waning after Alfred
